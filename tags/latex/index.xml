      <description>I find very complicated to write about Data Science without using mathematical formulas. That is why I think that the Medium editor is very unconvenient for scientific writing. While obviously there are many pubblications on Data Science, the articles turns to be quite shallow in term of details. I love and daily read from Towards Data Science and MLearning.ai, there is an obvious restraint from writing too much Math-dense articles.</description>
